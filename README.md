Building
------------

Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

On Unix systems (or Windows 10, with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) you can optionally run `build.sh` instead. Running this as-is will produce a .xpi file ending in `-dev`, and if run from the command line and appending a number (e.g. `./build.sh 2`) will append that number to the filename instead.

Information on producing the `xpt` files featured here using the `idl` files in `src/idl/` can be found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/XPIDL/Generating_xpt_on_Windows).

Download
------------

You can grab the latest release either from the Releases section of this repository, or the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/stylem/). Please ensure that `Stylish` is disabled or removed (if installed) before installing to prevent any issues. Stylem will pick up any installed styles.
